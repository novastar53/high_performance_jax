    "# How to Write a Flash Attention Kernel in Pallas\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous posts in this series, we learnt how to write a [matrix multiplication kernel](https://blog.vikrampawar.com/pallas-matmul.html) and a [softmax kernel](https://blog.vikrampawar.com/pallas-softmax.html) using Pallas. Building on these, we will design a fused self-attention kernel. Self-attention is a major bottleneck in deep learning architectures due to its O(N²) memory requirement. In a naive implementation, materializing the full N×N attention matrix requires O(N²) memory bandwidth. This creates a severe bottleneck on GPUs, as the time to transfer this data from high-bandwidth memory (HBM) dominates over the actual computation time."

    "## Self Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the self-attention operation is `softmax(QK^T / √d) @ V`, where Q is a set of queries, K is a set of keys and V is a set of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Queries (Q) are usually a tensor of shape `(B, H, T, D)`, where `B` is batch size, `H` is number of heads, `T` is sequence length, and `D` is the embedding dimension (or head dimension). Each query vector represents a position in the sequence that attends to keys. Keys are used to compute attention scores with queries while values are the information retrieved based on attention weights.\n",
    "Scaling by $1/\\sqrt{d}$ stabilizes the variance, ensuring the softmax behaves similarly across different embedding dimensions, improving optimization and generalization.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Precision Optimization: From Float32 to Bfloat16\n",
    "\n",
    "A key optimization in our implementation is the careful management of numerical precision. The naive approach of casting everything to float32 wastes memory bandwidth, while pure bfloat16 causes numerical instability. Our optimized approach uses **mixed precision**: bfloat16 for memory transfers and tensor core operations, float32 for sensitive intermediate computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem with Full Float32\n",
    "\n",
    "Our initial implementation cast all inputs to float32 immediately after loading:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# BEFORE: Suboptimal - wastes memory bandwidth\n",
    "q_reg = plgpu.load(q_ref.at[0, :, :]).astype(jnp.float32)  # 2x bandwidth\n",
    "k_blk = plgpu.load(k_ref.at[0, idx, :]).astype(jnp.float32)\n",
    "v_blk = plgpu.load(v_ref.at[0, idx, :]).astype(jnp.float32)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has two problems:\n",
    "1. **Double memory bandwidth**: Loading 4 bytes per element instead of 2\n",
    "2. **Slower tensor cores**: Float32 matmuls use TF32 tensor cores, which are slower than bf16 tensor cores\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Mixed Precision Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Our optimized implementation follows these principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operation | Dtype | Reason |\n",
    "|-----------|-------|--------|\n",
    "| Load Q, K, V, dO | bf16 | Half the memory bandwidth |\n",
    "| Matmul inputs | bf16 | Fast bf16 tensor cores |\n",
    "| Matmul outputs | float32 | Tensor cores accumulate in float32 |\n",
    "| Softmax (exp, max, sum) | float32 | Numerical stability |\n",
    "| Running accumulators | float32 | Avoid precision loss across blocks |\n",
    "| Store outputs | bf16 | Match input dtype |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Keep tensor loads as bfloat16:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# AFTER: Optimal - native bf16 loads\n",
    "q_reg = plgpu.load(q_ref.at[0, :, :])  # bf16, half the bandwidth\n",
    "k_blk = plgpu.load(k_ref.at[0, idx, :])  # bf16\n",
    "v_blk = plgpu.load(v_ref.at[0, idx, :])  # bf16\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Matmuls naturally output float32:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Q @ K^T: bf16 inputs, but tensor cores accumulate in float32\n",
    "s_blk = pl.dot(q_reg, k_blk, trans_b=True) / scale  # Output is float32\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Keep softmax computation in float32:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# These operations need float32 precision\n",
    "max_blk = jnp.maximum(max_reg, jnp.max(s_blk, axis=-1))  # float32\n",
    "s_blk = jnp.exp(s_blk - max_blk[:, None])  # float32 - exp is sensitive!\n",
    "l_blk = jnp.sum(s_blk, axis=-1)  # float32 accumulation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Cast back to bf16 for the next matmul:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# P @ V: cast P (attention weights) back to bf16 for fast tensor cores\n",
    "o_blk = pl.dot(s_blk.astype(v_blk.dtype), v_blk)  # bf16 inputs, float32 output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Accumulators must be float32:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# These accumulate across many blocks - bf16 would lose small contributions\n",
    "o_reg = jnp.zeros(q_reg.shape, jnp.float32)\n",
    "max_reg = jnp.full((BLOCK_R,), -jnp.inf, dtype=jnp.float32)\n",
    "l_reg = jnp.zeros((BLOCK_R,), dtype=jnp.float32)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "The precision optimization significantly improves performance by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Halving memory bandwidth** for Q, K, V, O, dO loads/stores\n",
    "2. **Using faster bf16 tensor cores** for matrix multiplications\n",
    "3. **Maintaining numerical correctness** through float32 intermediates\n",
    "\n",
    "Before optimization (float32 everywhere):\n",
    "```\n",
    "Forward:  0.642 ms  (T=1024)\n",
    "Backward: 7.309 ms  (T=1024)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After optimization (mixed bf16/float32):\n",
    "```\n",
    "Forward:  0.294 ms  (T=1024)  - 2.2x faster\n",
    "Backward: 0.943 ms  (T=1024)  - 7.7x faster\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The backward pass sees a larger improvement because it has more memory traffic (loading Q, K, V, O, dO, logsumexp, D) that benefits from the reduced bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Certain Values Must Stay Float32\n",
    "\n",
    "**Running max (`max_reg`)**: Could technically be bf16 since it's just tracking maximums, but keeping it float32 costs nothing (only BLOCK_R=64 elements) and avoids edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Running sum (`l_reg`)**: Must be float32. It accumulates across all K blocks:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "l_reg = l_reg * jnp.exp(max_reg - max_blk) + l_blk\n",
    "```\n",
    "With T=4096 and BLOCK_C=64, that's 64 iterations. Bf16 would lose small contributions when adding to large sums.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logsumexp**: Used in backward pass as `exp(s_blk - logsumexp)`. Errors in the exponent get amplified exponentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output accumulator (`o_reg`)**: Same accumulation issue as `l_reg` - must be float32 to avoid losing small corrections."

    "## Limitations and Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Achievement\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Pallas implementation now achieves performance **competitive with NVIDIA's cuDNN flash attention**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Forward pass**: Within 3-10% of cuDNN at large sequence lengths (T≥1024)\n",
    "- **Backward pass**: Actually **outperforms cuDNN** in throughput at most sequence lengths\n",
    "\n",
    "This was achieved through careful mixed-precision optimization (see the Precision Optimization section above).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remaining Gaps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Small sequence lengths**: At T<512, kernel launch overhead dominates and naive attention can be faster. Production implementations often fall back to naive attention for short sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Forward pass at T=4096**: cuDNN is slightly faster (2.29ms vs 2.37ms). This is likely due to better autotuning of block sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **No causal masking optimization**: Causal attention can skip computation for masked positions, but our implementation computes the full attention matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pallas Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Pallas provides a high-level abstraction for writing GPU kernels, but it doesn't expose certain low-level primitives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No warp-level programming**: Pallas doesn't provide access to `warp_id` or warp shuffle operations. You can configure `num_warps` but cannot coordinate work between warps within a block.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limited shared memory control**: Pallas manages shared memory implicitly through `BlockSpec`. You cannot explicitly allocate shared memory or control synchronization barriers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No atomic operations**: Pallas on GPU doesn't expose `atomic_add`, requiring separate kernels for reductions (like our three-kernel backward pass).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Path to Further Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Autotuning block sizes**: Our fixed BLOCK_R=BLOCK_C=64 may not be optimal for all configurations. Dynamic tuning could help.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fusing backward kernels**: The three-kernel approach adds overhead. With careful synchronization, these could potentially be fused.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Causal masking**: Skip computation for masked positions in the attention matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Educational Value\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite targeting production-level performance, this implementation retains significant educational value:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Algorithm clarity**: The tiled computation with online softmax correction is clearly visible in the code\n",
    "- **Gradient derivation**: The backward pass shows exactly how gradients flow through attention\n",
    "- **Precision analysis**: The mixed-precision strategy demonstrates real-world optimization thinking\n",
    "- **Debugging**: `INTERPRET_MODE=True` allows stepping through the algorithm on CPU"
