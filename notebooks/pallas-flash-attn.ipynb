    "# How to Write a Flash Attention Kernel in Pallas\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous posts in this series, we learnt how to write a [matrix multiplication kernel](https://blog.vikrampawar.com/pallas-matmul.html) and a [softmax kernel](https://blog.vikrampawar.com/pallas-softmax.html) using Pallas. Building on these, we will design a fused self-attention kernel. Self-attention is a major bottleneck in deep learning architectures. In a naive implementation, materializing the full N\u00d7N attention matrix requires O(N\u00b2) memory bandwidth. This creates a severe bottleneck on GPUs, as the time to transfer this data from high-bandwidth memory (HBM) dominates over the actual computation time."

    "## Self Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the self-attention operation is `softmax(QK^T / \u221ad) @ V`, where Q is a set of queries, K is a set of keys and V is a set of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Queries (Q) are usually a tensor of shape `(B, H, T, D)`, where `B` is batch size, `H` is number of heads, `T` is sequence length, and `D` is the embedding dimension (or head dimension). Each query vector represents a position in the sequence that attends to keys. Keys are used to compute attention scores with queries while values are the information retrieved based on attention weights.\n",
    "Scaling by $1/\\sqrt{d}$ stabilizes the variance, ensuring the softmax behaves similarly across different embedding dimensions, improving optimization and generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the basics of self-attention in more detail, [here's](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2023/self-attention-from-scratch.html) an excellent blogpost by Sebastian Raschka.\n",

    "## Minimal GPU System Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "To test our implementation, we will use an NVIDIA RTX 4000 Ada Generation GPU. This is fairly powerful (and cheap!) modern GPU architecture. Let's build a simple model of its system architecture. This will help us understand compute and memory tradeoffs involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "![rtx-sys-diag](rtx_4000_ada_system_diagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "The RTX 4000 Ada has 20 GB of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) with 360 GB/s bandwidth. This stores all our input and output tensors (Q, K, V, O, gradients). Each streaming multiprocessor (SM) has 128 KB of shared memory (SMEM/L1 cache) with ~10-30 TB/s bandwidth\u2014this is where we'll store our tiles. The GPU's tensor cores deliver 106.9 TFLOP/s peak compute for bfloat16 operations. There's also a 48 MB L2 cache shared across all SMs, but it's hardware-managed and not directly accessible from Pallas kernels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory Hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "SMEM/L1 cache (128 KB per SM) is the fastest memory. At ~10-30 TB/s bandwidth, it's orders of magnitude faster than HBM. Crucially, it's software-managed\u2014we explicitly control what gets loaded and stored via `plgpu.load` and `plgpu.store` in our Pallas kernels. Each SM has its own 128 KB, isolated from others. This is where flash attention keeps intermediate tiles, attention score tiles, and accumulators. \n",
    "\n",
    "L2 cache (48 MB) sits in the middle. However, it's hardware-managed\u2014we can't directly access it from Pallas kernels. All SMs compete for this shared space, and hardware may evict data between operations. The kernel design assumes data lives in SMEM or HBM only.\n",
    "\n",
    "HBM (20 GB) is the slowest memory at 360 GB/s, but it has the largest capacity. This stores all our tensors, Q, K, V inputs, O outputs, and gradients dQ, dK, dV. Every read or write to HBM costs execution time, so minimizing HBM transfers is critical for performance. Flash attention reads Q, K, V from HBM once and writes O to HBM once\u2014everything else stays in SMEM.\n",

    "## Precision Optimization: From Float32 to Bfloat16\n",
    "\n",
    "A key optimization in our implementation is the careful management of numerical precision. The naive approach of casting everything to float32 wastes memory bandwidth, while pure bfloat16 causes numerical instability. Our optimized approach uses **mixed precision**: bfloat16 for memory transfers and tensor core operations, float32 for sensitive intermediate computations. Our optimized implementation follows these principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operation | Dtype | Reason |\n",
    "|-----------|-------|--------|\n",
    "| Load Q, K, V, dO | bf16 | Half the memory bandwidth |\n",
    "| Matmul inputs | bf16 | Fast bf16 tensor cores |\n",
    "| Matmul outputs | float32 | Tensor cores accumulate in float32 |\n",

    "| Running accumulators | float32 | Avoid precision loss across blocks |\n",
    "| Store outputs | bf16 | Match input dtype |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Certain Values Must Stay Float32\n",
    "\n",
    "**Running max (`max_reg`)**: Could technically be bf16 since it's just tracking maximums, but keeping it float32 costs nothing (only BLOCK_R=64 elements) and avoids edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Running sum (`l_reg`)**: Must be float32. It accumulates across all K blocks:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "l_reg = l_reg * jnp.exp(max_reg - max_blk) + l_blk\n",
    "```\n",
    "With T=1024 and BLOCK_C=64, that's 64 iterations. Bf16 would lose small contributions when adding to large sums.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logsumexp**: Used in backward pass as `exp(s_blk - logsumexp)`. Errors in the exponent get amplified exponentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output accumulator (`o_reg`)**: Same accumulation issue as `l_reg` - must be float32 to avoid losing small corrections."

    "## Limitations and Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Achievement\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Pallas implementation now achieves performance **competitive with NVIDIA's cuDNN flash attention**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Forward pass**: Within 3-10% of cuDNN at large sequence lengths (T\u22651024)\n",
    "- **Backward pass**: Actually **outperforms cuDNN** in throughput at most sequence lengths\n",
    "\n",
    "This was achieved through careful mixed-precision optimization (see the Precision Optimization section above).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remaining Gaps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Small sequence lengths**: At T<512, kernel launch overhead dominates and naive attention can be faster. Production implementations often fall back to naive attention for short sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Forward pass at T=4096**: cuDNN is slightly faster (2.29ms vs 2.37ms). This is likely due to better autotuning of block sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **No causal masking optimization**: Causal attention can skip computation for masked positions, but our implementation computes the full attention matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pallas Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Pallas provides a high-level abstraction for writing GPU kernels, but it doesn't expose certain low-level primitives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No warp-level programming**: Pallas doesn't provide access to `warp_id` or warp shuffle operations. You can configure `num_warps` but cannot coordinate work between warps within a block.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limited shared memory control**: Pallas manages shared memory implicitly through `BlockSpec`. You cannot explicitly allocate shared memory or control synchronization barriers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No atomic operations**: Pallas on GPU doesn't expose `atomic_add`, requiring separate kernels for reductions (like our three-kernel backward pass).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Path to Further Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Autotuning block sizes**: Our fixed BLOCK_R=BLOCK_C=64 may not be optimal for all configurations. Dynamic tuning could help.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fusing backward kernels**: The three-kernel approach adds overhead. With careful synchronization, these could potentially be fused.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Causal masking**: Skip computation for masked positions in the attention matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Educational Value\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite targeting production-level performance, this implementation retains significant educational value:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Algorithm clarity**: The tiled computation with online softmax correction is clearly visible in the code\n",
    "- **Gradient derivation**: The backward pass shows exactly how gradients flow through attention\n",
    "- **Precision analysis**: The mixed-precision strategy demonstrates real-world optimization thinking\n",
    "- **Debugging**: `INTERPRET_MODE=True` allows stepping through the algorithm on CPU"
